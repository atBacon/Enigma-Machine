# Enigma-Machine
Encodes and decodes strings, gives two outputs, one will be more encoded and one will be less. Which is which?

I would have liked a simpler solution, but I wasn't happy with the ones that I created when I tried that.

Uses the ASCII character codes of the input, does an undisclosed amount of maths on them, and then returns them

Neither output 1 nor 2 are "more" or "less" encoded than the other, instead they are just encoded in different "directions"
Taking one output from one, and then another from one, is like taking two steps in a single direction.
But, then, by using an input from two, it is like stepping in the oppsite direction
